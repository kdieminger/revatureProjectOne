# Richard's Coding Watchwords
Things I personally think are incredibly and absolutely important when coding.

## Readability
Your code should be easy to read for yourself and for your team. Code that is difficult to read ruins a project.

Unreadable Code is:
* difficult to refactor
* difficult to optimize
* difficult to trace
* difficult to debug


## Modularity
Your code should be broken up into distinct logical pieces that each perform some discrete and well-defined function.

Unmodularized code is:
* difficult to read (Everything is in the same place.)
* difficult to reuse

## Reusability
Don't write the same code twice.
