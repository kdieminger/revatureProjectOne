# Naming Conventions

* camelCase
* PascalCase
* snake_case
* UPPER_CASE
* lowercase
* name.domain.reverse <= java

## JavaScript conventions
1. Variable names are `camelCase`.
2. Function names are `camelCase`.
3. Class names are `PascalCase`.
4. File names are `lowercase`.
5. Constructor Functions are `PascalCase` (usually).

Something I often see in other languages (but NOT JavaScript) is `UPPER_CASE` for constant values.

`__`: A double underscore in JavaScript denotes a field or member you are not intended to be using.

JavaScript doesn't really have any concept of a "private" member, so that shorthand or convention is a way to tell someone that's what you want without actually being able to do it.

# Disclaimer
The correct naming convention is the one used by your company.
