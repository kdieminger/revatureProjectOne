### Interpreted
Not compiled. Is run without being rewritten as machine code. The code is executed as it is read.
### Compiled
When you compile a program you are transforming your high-level code into lower-level code that the computer can run.

### High-level Code
Close to English. Understandable by humans. We do not need to be aware of the machine architecture upon which our code is running (to a certain extent, see C)
* C
* C++
* C#
* Java
* JavaScript
* Python
* Ruby
* etc.
### Low-Level Code
Closer to binary. Harder for humans to understand, easier for machines to compile. Fine control over machine. Efficient
* Assembly

### Scripting Language
A language that is intended to automate tasks.

### Coding Paradigm
A way to think about solving a problem.

#### Object-Oriented Programming Paradigm
When I have a problem, I model that problem as an object or objects, then I use those objects state and behaviors to solve the problem.
#### Functional Paradigm
When I have a problem, I create functions that, when called, will solve the problem.
#### Event-driven Paradigm
When I have a problem, I create an event, that when triggered, will solve the problem.
