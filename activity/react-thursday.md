1. I should only be able to add a restaurant if I'm an employee. If I'm not an employee, the button should not even appear.

2. As an employee, I can delete a restaurant.

3. As a Restaurant component, I should incorporate a link to the RestaurantDetails component for my specific restaurant and that page should display more information that I do.

4. As an employee, I should see a button that takes me to a component that allows me to edit an existing restaurant.
